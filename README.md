Hearthstone Card Search in the Terminal
==============

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lnMcaWu.png)

This is a work in progress script written in ruby to search for specific cards via [hearthstoneapi.com](http://hearthstoneapi.com)

It already supports autocompletion with tab, so ed and tab will become "edwin van cleef" and formats it according so it can search the api. The tab completion will show all 382 cards. These have been downloaded from the API and stored in the repo for fast access. You can now also search directly via the command line with the -c or --card argument.

Search now works and displays something useful. Would like to have a picture or ascii version in the future.

Input and contributions are always welcome!
