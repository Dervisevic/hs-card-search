Ruby Terminal Hearthstone card search
==============

This is a work in progress script written in ruby to search for specific cards via http://hearthstoneapi.com

It already supports autocompletion, so ed will become "edwin van cleef" and formats it according so it can search the api. The tab completion will show all 382 cards.

Searching already works but presentation is still being worked on.

In the future i would like to display the card somehow as well., maybe even ascii.
