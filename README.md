Hearthstone Card Search in the Terminal
==============

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lnMcaWu.png)

This is a work in progress script written in ruby to search for specific cards via [hearthstoneapi.com](http://hearthstoneapi.com)

It already supports autocompletion, so ed"<tab>" will become "edwin van cleef" and formats it according so it can search the api. The tab completion will show all 382 cards. These have been downloaded from the API and stored in the repo for fast access.

Search now works and displays something useful. Would like to have a picture or ascii version in the future. Would also like to avoid having to run the script but using it from terminal directly. 

Input and contributions are always welcome!
